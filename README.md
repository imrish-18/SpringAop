 spring aspect programming
 Aspect-Oriented Programming entails breaking down program logic into distinct parts called so-called concerns.
 The functions that span multiple points of an application are called cross-cutting concerns and these cross-cutting concerns are conceptually separate from the application's business logic. There are various common good examples of aspects like logging, auditing, declarative transactions, security, caching, etc.
